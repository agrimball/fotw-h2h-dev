# Coding Practices

All Python code is written in Python 3 (no Python 2.7!). 

All C++ binaries use the Gflags command line parser (https://gflags.github.io/gflags/).

All C++ tests use the googletest test-runner (https://github.com/google/googletest).

Please see the cc_example/ directory to see what C++ code should generally look
like (as well as to get an idea of how to write C++ that's built with Bazel).
